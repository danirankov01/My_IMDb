# My_IMDb
Inspired by IMDb website - the popular database related to TV series, video games and movies. Check out my version:

You can find information about your favorite games by being able to search by different categories, genre and even different platforms. You can toggle between dark and light mode. For this project, I have no credit for the front-end part. My goal was to practice my React skills by creating an application that could work well with the rawg API. I hope you like it.
